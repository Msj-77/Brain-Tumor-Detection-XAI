# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using CNN & XAI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI scans using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. In addition to achieving accurate tumor classification, we integrate **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques such as **Grad-CAM, SHAP, and LIME** to improve transparency and interpretability in medical AI applications.

## 🚀 Features
- **Deep Learning-based Brain Tumor Classification**  
- **Pretrained Model Support** (ResNet, VGG16, EfficientNet, etc.)  
- **Explainability with XAI** (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME)  
- **Model Training and Optimization**  
- **Deployment as an API or Web App**  

## 📂 How to Get Started
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Brain-Tumor-Detection-CNN.git
cd Brain-Tumor-Detection-CNN
```

### **2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment**
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### **3️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4️⃣ Run the Training Script**
```sh
python train.py
```

## 🔍 Explainable AI (XAI)
To ensure model transparency, we integrate **XAI techniques**:
- **Grad-CAM** - Highlights important regions in MRI scans.
- **SHAP** - Shows feature importance in predictions.
- **LIME** - Explains individual classification decisions.

These techniques help **doctors and researchers** understand **why** the model makes a certain prediction.

## 🛠 Deployment
We plan to deploy the trained model as:
- **Flask API** - To serve predictions through an API.
- **Streamlit Web App** - To provide a user-friendly interface.
